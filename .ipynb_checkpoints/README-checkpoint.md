### The task:

Projective normalization

To solve this problem it is necessary to find the vanishing point.
It can be found using the discrete Radon transform - known in image processing
as the Hough transform [1]. We know the algorithms are known for fast calculation of the Hough transform (HFT), for example, the Brady method [2, 3].

A program and a set of data are given. It is necessary to describe, on the basis of what assumptions
It is necessary to describe on the basis of what assumptions projective transformation was found.

Data set: at least 10 pictures of a multi-storey building with windows, taken
from below upwards and with the horizon obscured.
